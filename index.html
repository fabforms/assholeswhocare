      We are just a bunch of assholes, former assholes, part time assholes, assholes in recovery and recovered assholes
      Doing random acts of kindness and  changing lives  for good in Uganda for the better.
      <p>We handpick and vet all candidates seeking help.</p>
      <p>Our primary goal is to help people with a desire to become self sufficent by helping them create a honest and stable livlihood to help them and their loved ones </p>
      <p>Most times candidates come to us with a small starting point or small working business  and lots and lots of hope. 
      (Well you can't eat <strong>f*&king</strong> hope, thats where us Assholes come in)</p>
      <p> We help them achieve  the goal of becoming self sufficient and not needing handouts or the help of a bunch of assholes again.
