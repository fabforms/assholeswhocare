      <p>Our primary goal is to make real impactful recurring change in peoples lives in Uganda 
      with a desire to become  self sufficent . Most times they come with a small starting point and hope. (Well you can't eat fecking hope, thats where us Assholes come in.)x</p>  
       helping them achieve  a self sustaining livehood so they can  provide for themseleves and their families.
